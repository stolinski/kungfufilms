This list features mostly movies from the 1970's produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio.

The icons present show if the film is in my personal collection. If the film is available on Youtube to watch, there will be a Youtube logo as a link to view the film.

The star rating is my own personal rating on the film, films without a rating have not yet been seen by me.
